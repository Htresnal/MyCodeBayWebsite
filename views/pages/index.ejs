                <h1>Welcome to My Code Bay</h1>
                <p>This website was made as a personal handbook for articles, showcase for my programs and interesting links. Here you may find stuff about programming, PC performance and bug dealing.</p>
                <p>My name is Sergey Lunev. I'm a programmer, and I work on projects based on C++, Java and Javascript.
                </p>
                <p> I've started learning programming when I was studying at the "Federal Academy of Slavic Culture". Now I'm gravitating towards IT and programming.<br>
                </p>
                <p>My projects:<br>
                <strong><a href="/programs">Damage Analysis Tool</a></strong> - Works similar to a game engine. My first big program. Copies data from the original game files, emulating in-game processes.  <br>
                <strong><a href="/programs">LPT Port Controller</a></strong> - My first attempt in non-trivial hardware access. Allows control over LPT data channels, and can be used for testing LPT, controlling robots and etc.<br>
                <strong><a href="/programs">File Thrower</a></strong> - I've made it on both Java and C++, but only decided to post the Java version. Its the file transmitter programm, that allows you to connect by IP address, and send a file over the network. Runs the file, if both the sender and the receiver are agreed to open the file after load(corresponding check is set on at both sides).
                <strong><a href="http://prepresstools.ru">PrepressTools.ru</a></strong> - Co-creator of the project. Plugins for Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, for a typography niche.
